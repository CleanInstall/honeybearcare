                  <h2>Infants & Toddler</h2>
                  <p class="program_info">
                     More and more infants and toddlers are spending time each day in some type of child care setting. All children—especially infants and toddlers—need a child care setting where they can thrive with caregivers who understand how to promote their healthy growth and development. That's because young children need a schedule that is responsive to their needs, with appropriate stimulation and time to rest. They need to be talked to and played with. They need love and attention. And they need the opportunity to form the kind of comfortable, secure relationship with a caregiver that will nurture their healthy emotional development.

                  <h2>Two's</h2>
                  <p class="program_info">
                     During the Infant and Toddler years, your child has been busy gathering every tool and honing every instinct they will require for the expedition which lies before them as they enter their Twos. What a journey it will be! There will be hills to glide over, valleys to traverse, and mountains of development to climb on the way to reach the pinnacle of early childhood development that is represented by the Pre-K experience. Along the way, there will be challenges (for parents and children), successes, and mistakes. It will be key for parents and caregivers to understand that a mistake is simply a learning moment to be embraced and that repeated opportunities to engage in choices and learn from mistakes will give a child the confidence to try and will provide the security they need to trust themselves and assert their independence.

                  <h2>Pre School</h2>
                  <p class="program_info">
                     Your child has worked and learned so much through play and exploration from the moment they entered our world and has finally reached the day when they will begin the Preschool portion of the journey. This important final step in preparation for Kindergarten and the academic years beyond lays the foundations of success that your child will build upon throughout this year and into the future.
