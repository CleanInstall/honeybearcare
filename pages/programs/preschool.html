                        Assessment for readiness at Honey Bear Care is a quiet endeavor that is conducted through careful observation and planning on the part of the teacher and directors. Each child is assessed regularly throughout the school year and progress is communicated at bi-annual conferences which parents are expected to attend. At conference, the teacher will happily share social/emotional, developmental, and academic progress observations of your child; yet, your child will never feel as if he or she has been tested.
                     </p>
      
                     <p>
                        Do preschoolers have homework? If a child is showing particular interest in a topic under discussion or if a family requests support materials for home, these are provided. Mainly, our teachers enjoy planning a creative monthly project which children and parents can complete together at home and which returns to school for sharing time and classroom display. This project is often specifically aligned to the character education topic or theme associated with each month of the curriculum; but, allows students and parents to work together to creatively produce a project that reflects who they are and which celebrates the family and the individual. Additionally, teachers may suggest interactive word games great for playing on the go and as a family as well as sight word reinforcement activities. All activities are suggestions and are not required.
                     </p>

                        Note: The preschool program welcomes students who are four years old by September 1 of the current year. Students under the age of four who show advanced academic and social/emotional skills and for whom teachers agree that the preschool environment will be developmentally appropriate,may be considered for early entry. A child should have attended Honey Bear Care for a minimum of one full year prior to consideration to allow for an ample observation and assessment period.
